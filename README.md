# GitHubScraper
A simple Java / Selenium based application that scrapes all the trending repositories and the number of stars per programming language of choice and saves all this data in a .csv file

I was just playing around with Selenium for the first time and wanted to just experiment. Not meant to be a standalone project by any standard.
